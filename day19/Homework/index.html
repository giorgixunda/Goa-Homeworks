    <p>An IT Service Management (ITSM) program is a strategic approach towards managing your IT department and its operations. ITSM can help with design, delivery, management and improvement of information technology services and support individuals who are managing services. It creates better alignment between business needs and IT services, delivers more predictable IT performance and costs, and contributes to continual improvement of IT effectiveness and capabilities. Orderly and well-managed IT processes enable organizations to spend less time on firefighting and more time on strategic initiatives.</p>
