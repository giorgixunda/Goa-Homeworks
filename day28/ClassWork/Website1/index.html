        <p>Santa Claus, legendary figure who is the 
        <br>traditional patron of Christmas in the United 
        <br>States and other countries, bringing gifts to 
        <br>children. His popular image is based on 
        <br>traditions associated with Saint Nicholas, a 
        <br>4th-century Christian saint. Father Christmas 
        <br>fills the role in many European countries.</p>

        <p>The Dutch are credited with transporting the 
        <br>legend of Saint Nicholas (Sinterklaas) to New 
        <br>Amsterdam (now New York City), along with 
        <br>the custom of giving gifts and sweets to 
        <br>children on his feast day, December 6. The 
        <br>current depiction of Santa Claus is based on 
        <br>images drawn by cartoonist Thomas Nast for 
        <br>Harper’s Weekly beginning in 1863. Nast’s 
        <br>Santa owed much to the description given in 
        <br>the poem “A Visit from St. Nicholas” (also 
        <br>known as “’Twas the Night Before Christmas”), 
        <br>first published in 1823. The image was further 
        <br>defined by the popular Santa Claus 
        <br>advertisements created for the Coca-Cola 
        <br>Company from 1931 by illustrator Haddon 
        <br>Sundblum. Sundblum’s Santa was a portly 
        <br>white-bearded gentleman dressed in a red suit 
        <br>with a black belt and white fur trim, black 
        <br>boots, and a soft red cap.</p>
